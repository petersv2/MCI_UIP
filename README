* Input file organization

This code assumes Each patient's images are located in a folder 
with the same name as that patient's ID. 

It also assumes that inside this folder are 3 subfolders called CT/, MCI/, mask/ .
The CT/ folder contains the CT image for that patient. The MCI/ folder
contains one or more MCI images, more specifically, one MCI image for 
each value of the sigma parameter. The mask/ folder contains the binary
segmentation of the lungs. 

It is also assumed that all individual patient's folders are located together 
into a single parent folder.
      
* Input image format

The code is currently written with the assumption that input images are in the
NRRD image format with the .nhdr extension, but any 3D image format that
can be read with SimpleITK can be used as well.

* CSV file with patient diagnoses

It is assumed a csv file is provided with the IDs of patients included in the study,
as well as their correponding diagnostic label. It is assumed this csv file has two columns
called 'name' and 'Diagnosis'. For each row, the entry in column 'name' should correspond
to the patient ID which is the same as the name of the folder containing that patient's
images (see above). That patient's diagnostic label should be listed in column 'Diagnosis'.

* Original SOFIA pipeline

For the original SOFIA pipeline, 500 random 2x2 montages need to be created 
for each patient. This is done with create_SOFIA_montages.ipynb
These montages are then loaded when the dataset class is instantiated 
(as defined in file dataset_SOFIA.py).

Training of the model is done with the code in SOFIA_training.ipynb, testing is done
with the code in SOFIA_testing.ipynb

* Simplified SOFIA pipeline

No need for montage creation, the input slices are set up and loaded when the dataset class is
instantiated (file  dataset_SimplifiedSOFIA.py ).

Training of the model is done with the code in SOFIA_training.ipynb, testing is done
with the code in SOFIA_testing.ipynb
